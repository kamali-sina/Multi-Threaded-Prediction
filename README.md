# Multi-Threaded-Prediction
A multi-threaded C program that predicts prices based on trained regression data. This project illustrates the effects of parallelizing programs to achieve maximum efficiency.

## Description

There are two methods of prediction available in the repo. Serial prediction and parallel prediction. By Testing these two codes we can find the amount of speed we gain by parallelizing our code.
